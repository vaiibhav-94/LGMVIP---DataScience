# Lets Grow More Virtual Internship Programme Tasks

This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for Data Science for [Lets Grow More](https://letsgrowmore.in//)

### Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook

### Task 1 : Iris Flowers Classification MLProject
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers 
dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms,
mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, itcan easily fit in memory without 
requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
      

### Task 2 : Stock Market PredictionAnd Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

### Task 3 : Music Recommendation
Music recommender systems cansuggest songs to users based on theirlistening patterns.
     
### Task 4 : Image to Pencil Sketch with Python
We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image.This will turn an image 
into a classic blackand white photo. Then the next thing to dois invert the grayscale image also called 
negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used toenhance details. 
Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. 
This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, 
we can easily dothis programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.
     
### Task 5 : Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset- Terrorism
As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. You can choose any of the tool 
your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
     
### Task 6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data 
to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
